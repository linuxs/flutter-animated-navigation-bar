# Animated Navigation Bar (Flutter)

Recently I've found myself loving Flutter, so I thought it would be fun to create a couple Flutter based libraries to contribute to the community. After searching Dribbble for a little bit I stumbled accross this animation: https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1405777/screenshots/5315582/video.gif

This repository is going to include a functional copy of this animation for the bottom navigation bar. This is also to increase my skills with motion animations on a native level.

I'll update this readme accordingly.
